  "summary": "A generic NSFetchedResultsController replacement for iOS, written in Swift.",
  "description": "The GenericResultsController is an NSFetchedResultsController replacement for iOS, that is used to\nmanage the results of any data fetch from any data source and to display that data to the user. The\ncontroller provides an abstracted API that is intentionally simple and makes no assumptions about \nhow you manage your connection to the underlying data store. It also provides strong support for Swift\ngenerics by enabling you to customize the request and result types. The goal of this project is to \nprovide a data controller with similar functionality to NSFetchedResultsController but with the core \nfunctionality (e.g. sectionning and diffing) abstracted out, giving you the ability to interface with \nany data source using any kind of data model.",
