  "summary": "A generic NSFetchedResultsController replacement for iOS, written in Swift.",
  "description": "The GenericResultsController is an NSFetchedResultsController replacement for iOS, that is used to\nmanage the results of any data fetch from any data store and to display that data to the user. The\ncontroller provides an abstracted API that is intentionally simple and makes no assumptions\nabout how you manage your connection to the underlying data store. The goal of this project is\nto provide a data controller with similar functionality to NSFetchedResultsController but with\nthe ability to interface with any data set from any data store using any kind of data model.",
