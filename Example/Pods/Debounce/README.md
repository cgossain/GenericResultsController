## Requirements

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Debounce into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Debounce', '~> 1.5.1'
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Debounce as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/cgossain/Debounce.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.5.1"))
]
```
